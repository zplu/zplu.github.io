I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland. My research applies machine learning and econometric methods to address marketing problems. 

I am a methodologist working on explainable AI and novel adaptation of research methods to marketing. Currently I am working on AI-generated customer journeys for consumer privacy protection, much like how large language models (LLMs) generate sentences. I am also interested in product assortment analysis using generative AI, and I am developing a tool for feature-free image-based assortment analysis.

Before joining the PhD program, I received my background training in physics at Fudan University in Shanghai. I will be on the job market in the summer of 2025.

In my first essay, "AI for Customer Journeys: A Transformer Approach," I propose a transformer-based framework that models customer-firm interactions over time, similar to how a sentence is modeled as a sequence of words by Large Language Models. I improve the original transformer architecture to account for customer heterogeneity, and facilitate model learning by sharing knowledge across different types of touchpoint predictions. The model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in predicting customer journeys, as demonstrated through both empirical comparisons and extensive simulations. With firms facing increasing privacy regulations, I'm now exploring a novel solution that integrates AI-generated customer journeys with aggregate-level marketing mix data, mitigating the effects of data fragmentation. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
